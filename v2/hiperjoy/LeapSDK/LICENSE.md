Opting out shall not limit Ultraleap’s right to redistribute, either fully or partially, in a materially unaltered form, any material released publicly by you connected with your usage of the Ultraleap Technology on social media, blogs, or analogous platforms. The rights set out in this section 6(c) will survive termination of this A56.1.eeme

6.	End User Licensing and Other Licences.

6(a) Example code made publicly available by Ultraleap on its developer website may be provided subject to the Apache 2.0 licence, this Agreement, or other licences, as specified in the notice or readme files distributed with the example or in related documentation.

6(c) Section 6(b) shall not apply to users using the Ultraleap Software in a multi-user environment pursuant to Section 2(d), subject to the organisation in control of such multi-user environment having agreed to a licence in accordance with section 6(b) as if it were an End User.

7.	High Risk Uses and Waiver.

7(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, you are not licensed to, and you agree not to, use, copy, sell, offer for sale, or distribute the Ultraleap Technology (whether compiled with, incorporated into, or packaged with your Ultraleap Enabled Application or any other hardware or software product or otherwise), for or in connection with uses where failure or fault of the Ultraleap Technology or your Ultraleap Enabled Application could lead to death or personal injury, or to severe property or environmental damage (“High Risk Use”). Any such use is strictly prohibited.

7(b) If you choose to use the Ultraleap Technology in contravention of section 7(a) you hereby: (i) assume all risk that use of the Ultraleap Technology and/or such other software by you or by any others causes any harm or loss, including to the End User or other users of your Ultraleap Enabled Applications or to third parties; (ii) waive, on behalf of yourself and your Authorised Users, all claims against Ultraleap and its Affiliates related to such use, harm or loss (including, but not limited to, any claim that Ultraleap Technology is defective); and, (iii) agree to hold Ultraleap and its Affiliates harmless from such claims.
